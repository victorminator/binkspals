# Finding a penpal

As a student, you can use BinksPals to find a new penpal every 30 days. On top of that you can specify the countries you'd prefer exchanging with in the settings. And sometimes, you don't even have to do anything but wait to meet some new penpals. This page will provide you some more details regarding these subjects.

## How to find a penpal?

### 1. Find penpal feature

Go in the main menu and click on the _Find Penpal_ button:

// Tuto video here //

And that's as simple as that! 

!!!Info
    This feature is limited to one use every 30 days. So make sure you have properly configured your settings to get a penpal from the countries you'd prefer exchange with in the first place.

### 2. Let yoursel be surprised

You may meet new penpals just out of patience. As long as you are **visible**, other students from everywhere in the world may get your school's address information associated with your name by clicking on the _Find Penpal_ button.

!!!Note
    You cannot know if someone has gotten your school's address details until you receive their letter and vice-versa. It's better to maintain the surprise, isn't it ;)

## Customising your preferences

### 1. Setting your countries preferences

Do you prefer getting a penpal from Japan? Or maybe Romania? Or you'd like meeting a new penpal from Brazil? Then this part will interest you.

To modify your country preferences, click on the _Settings_ icon (the rightmost icon at the bottom menu) :

// Insert tuto image here //

Then enter the **country codes** (and not the country names) of the countries you'd prefer exchanging with in this input field :

// Insert tuto image //

If you have multiple countries in mind, separate their code with a **comma** (,). For instance, if I'd prefer having penpals from Norway, Madagascar or Canada, I would enter :

// Insert tuto image //

!!!Note
    The order you enter the country codes does not matter. So for example, _"ie,cn,fr,au"_ is the same as _"cn,au,ie,fr"_.

### 2. Changing visibility settings

Click on the _Settings_ icon (the rightmost icon at the bottom menu) :

// Insert tuto image here //

Select or deselect the _Make me invisible_ option depending whether you'd like to be invisible (preventing others from getting your name and school information) or not.

!!!Tip
    Please make yourself invisible if you are currently not able to exchange with new penpals (going on holidays, too much stuff to do, etc...)

## The penpal book

Every time you click on the _Find penpal_ button, your newly met penpal's information will be saved in your **penpal book**. To access this book, simply click on the _Book_ icon at the bottom menu :

// Insert tuto image here //

Then, all you have to do is to click on the penpal of your choice to access their school's address information. For example, if I want to access James Healy's school address details, I would click on his name :
