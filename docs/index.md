## What is BinksPals ?

BinksPals is a mobile application targeting schools and other educational establishments. The application promotes postal letter writing and international exchanges and allows students to get access to a foreign school's address within just one click. And to that school address is attached a student's name from this same school. All that added together gives a new penpal the student may communicate with through postal letters. On top of granting this privilege to students, BinksPals may also help teachers who desire to organise an international exchange with other foreign schools by easily giving them access to all the schools and teachers subscribed to BinksPals.
