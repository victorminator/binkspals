## Become a representative

Admin accounts and school registrations need to be cautiously verified. We are not likely to be able to complete all these verifications alone quick enough to satisfy the BinksPals newcomers. To solve this, we need volunteering and reliable school BinksPals admin / teachers to help us accomplishing these tasks. Become one of them today by contacting us at [ourmail.com](values.md) and help contributing to the development of the BinksPals project. With your permission, we will value your assistance by mentionning you and your educational establishment in the [credits page](credits.md) (but this is not mandatory, you may choose not to appear in the credits).
