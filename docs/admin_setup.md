# Admin setup

This guide will help you activating your admin account by setting up BinksPals for your establishment.

## 1. Requirements

Before diving into it, please make sure that:

- You have used your school's public email address (the one we may find on the Web) when you created your BinksPals admin account.
- There's at least one teacher in your school interested towards using BinksPals
- There's at least one student in your school interested towards using BinksPals

## 2. Registering your school

1. Login to your admin account and click on _Register school_ // Insert tuto image here //

2. Fill in the required information :
    - School name: current name of the school
    - Age range: your school's students average age range (currently named school type but this will be soon replaced)
    - Country code: the country code of the country your school is located in (ex: ie for Ireland)
    - Citry: the city your school is located at
    - Postal address: your school's address street number and name
    - Postal code: school's city postal code

3. Wait until you are contacted by a BinksPals representative

    The representative may ask for further information in order to prove your identity.
    
## 3. Getting and communicating your school ID

Once the representative accepts your demand, they will send you your school ID. To activate your account and successfully register your establishment, there's just one final step:

- Go in the main menu and click on the _Activate_ button
- Click on the _I have received my ID_ button
- Enter the school ID you have received and click on the _Verify ID_ button

This school ID is also necessary when creating a student or teacher account in order to identify the establishment they are part of. However, in order for BinksPals to operate properly in your establishment, at least one teacher and one student should create an account. So all there is left to do now is to communicate this school ID to various teachers and students from your establishment and _only_ from your establishment.
