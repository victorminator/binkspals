## Curiosity

BinksPals values, before anything else, curiosity. Installing BinksPals certainly means that you are interested about discovering the world and its people, that you'd like to learn more about foreign cultures and traditions, and how the idea of normality differs from a country to another.

## Friendliness 

BinksPals relies on friendliness. You use BinksPals to make new friends or find exchange partners you'd certainly never have been able to meet otherwise. We insist on the term "friendliness" as finding a romantic partner is not BinksPals' purpose. So please don't act rude or adopt any kind of inappropriate behaviour since BinksPals' enjoyability depends on that.

## Tolerance

As an extenstion of friendliness, tolerance is also at the core of BinksPals' values. You join our community to meet people who might be drastically different from you as we value difference and diversity and we hope you do as well. BinksPals is supposed to be a peaceful and educational environment so please don't initiate conflicts because of one's beliefs / way of life or simply because one takes much time to answer your letter. To summarize within one sentence:

_**"Be patient, be cool, chill and relax."**_

## Generosity

BinksPals is all about giving and sharing. BinksPals' purpose is to meet people with whom you may initiate an exchange project. For this exchange to be successful, you have to give some of your time and goodwill. If you're a student and get into letter writing for example, you are encouraged to share your culture, talk about how you live, and you may also include small presents in your letter.

## Security

Binkspals is intended to be secure by design. To begin with, BinksPals is exclusive to educational establishments, so not anyone can have access to it. Secondly, account creation is controled through the process of activation (which requires asking for an activation key to a teacher, student, admin from your school and sometimes even to a BinksPals representative depending on the type of account you want to create). Furthermore, your personal data is safely encrypted in our database and we have taken measures to prevent some of the most frequent cyber-attacks (brute force, SQL injection, etc...) from causing harm to the application.

## Surprise

Surprise uh? Why is that? I don't know. Who knows?

## Imagination

We hope BinksPals will help you stimulating your imagination. Whether you're a student looking for a penpal to write with or a teacher aiming to initiate a exchange project, you will certainly have to use your creativity and your imagination to make the exchange unique.

## Open-mindedness

Surprise (wait what is that again?) often leads to open one's mind. BinksPals will gladly help you realizing exchanges which, we hope, will bring you new perspectives and ideas. We are convinced that realizing international exchanges enriches your mind and is a source of wonder. And as Socrates wrote: _"Wisdom begins in wonder"_.

## Ambition

BinksPals values daring adventurers with great ambition : teachers willing to forge unique experiences for their students, and students craving for discoveries and new experiences, willing to accomplish great things with people far away from them.

## Nostalgia

Are you a student? Are you fed up of sending text messages and social media? Do you dream about the good old days when people used to send letters by post? Then BinksPals is the right place for you!
