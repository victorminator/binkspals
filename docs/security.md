# Security Guide

This guide will introduce some of the good security practices in order to make BinksPals as enjoyable as possible for every user.

## Activating accounts

When you receive someone's activation key, **do not give it straight away without examination!** You will find on this page a list of activation requirements for each account type (student, teacher, and admin).

### Student's requirements

Activated student and teacher accounts may help students activating theirs. But before you communicate their communication key, please make sure that:

- The student demonstrates a high/fluent level in English as all exchanges with other students will be in English
- The student is part of your educational establishment
- The student is aware that BinksPals' purpose is to exchange _handwritten letters_ with students coming from foreign countries
- The student has asked you **in person**  to activate their account because _text messages and mails_ are not enough to prove one's identity.
- If not, please **meet in person** with the concerned student to make sure they have asked you to activate their BinksPals account and that you're not dealing with a fraud.
- The student used their real name and not a pseudo to create their account

### Teacher's requirements

A school's BinksPals admin may help teachers from their school to activate their account. Before communicating them their activation key, please make sure that:

- The teacher is part of your educational establishment
- The teacher is willing to promote BinksPals among their students and helping them activating their account
- You have met with the teacher in person to verify if they indeed asked for an account activation from you

### Admin's requirements

As a BinksPals representative, you are asked to examine the admin account activation and school registration demands. Before communicating them their school ID, please make sure that :

- The admin has used their public academic / professional email address (example: `ce.9741620t[at]ac-reunion.fr` for highschool Mémona Hintermann Afféjee) to create their account.
- If not, inform them that you would only communicate with their public academic / professional address
- If you can't find their email address on the Web or that they don't have one, phone them using their public phone number.
- Make sure that the information they entered regarding their school is relevant and that no mistakes were made.

## Safely exchanging with your penpals

As a student, you will exchange with penpals all over the world. However, to ensure your safety, we encourage you to follow these tips:

- Don't include contact details in your first letter (especially your postal address)
- Make sure your penpal can be trusted before giving them your contact details or sending letters to their personal postal address
- Before sending your first letter, verify that you are sending it to an educational establishment
- Never send or ask money in your letters, just don't
- If you think your penpal's behaviour is _excessively_ innapropriate, please report it by contacting us at `binkspals42[at]gmail.com`

## Reacting to suspicious activity

As a school BinksPals admin, your role is to always keep an eye out to detect suspicious activity in your establishment regarding the use of BinksPals. Examples of suspicious / undesirable accounts include:

- Multiple accounts associated with the same user
- The student / teacher has left your establishment
- Accounts that use a pseudo
- The student / teacher does not seem to be part of your establishment

As an admin, you have the power to **disable** such accounts as explained on [this page](admin.md).
