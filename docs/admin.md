# Admin account features

## Teacher account

Creating an admin account automatically creates a teacher account. Therefore, every admin account has an associated teacher account. To connect to your teacher account as an admin, just add a `.t` at the end of your email address, the password is the same as your admin account. Or just click on the `Switch to Teacher` option at the bottom of the main menu :

## Managing accounts 

As an admin, you may activate or disable student and teacher accounts associated to your school. For that, click on the `book` icon on the bottom menu :

A list of persons is now displayed on your screen. These persons are teachers and students who registered in BinksPals using your school's BinkPals ID. You may click on any of the displayed persons to access their account information and get the possibility to activate or disable their account.

These notifications keep you informed regarding the evolution of the use of BinksPals in your establishment including new accounts creations and relevant numbers (ex: number of times students from your school used the `Find Penpal`) among some others. The notifications also contain general information such as app updates, events organised by BinksPals, etc...
